Once you get your mind set on a goal and embark on the journey towards it, the vehicle you drive, plays a central role. *e.g.* consider driving a BMW or going instead on a donkey, one will take you there faster.

Your mindset, behaviors, intelligence, passions, etc. can be seen as the different parts of the car (named quotients here), and for the car to work well all the individual parts need to be in good shape, as well as balanced with each other. *e.g. *An explosive fast engine without the adequate steering system, will run the car into a wall once the first curve appears.

### The Car model

**IQ** (Intelligence quotient) is your engine's horse power.

**EQ** (Emotional quotient) is the Steering / Handling / breaking / aerodynamics, i.e. control systems in general.

**RQ** (relationship quotient) is who you take on that journey, friends, family, partners. Are they toxic or good for you, supportive or negative? (who do you keep vs cut out of your journey?).

**BQ** (body quotient) are the wheels and if the wheels "fall off the wagon" we aren't going nowhere, does not matter how good the IQ (engine is) ... Look after your health.

**FQ** (financial quotient) is a spare tire on the back, 401k, insurances, contracts that protect you. Its the backup/fallback plan that once something happens you're not immediately blocked on the journey, so that you'll be up and running the next day with a rental car, etc.

**PQ** (passion coefficient) is the fuel/gas, passion, consciousness, purpose, run out of that also don't go anywhere.

<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Self-Actualization is about understanding how good each of your coefficients are, and then deliberately work on developing the weaker quotient first.

*E.g.*

-   Developing your engine (IQ) while having a broken tire (health) will yield little improvement for the journey, fix the tire first.
-   Updating the rims on the tires (e.g. 6-pack abs) while having a bad leak in the fuel tank (passion/purpose) will soon leave you asking what's the point of all the BQ work?
-   A full gas tank (passion) without proper handing/steering will not allow you to control the car, and you will just burn out the fuel (passion) going in the wrong direction.
